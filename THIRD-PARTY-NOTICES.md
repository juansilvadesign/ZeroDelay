## 4. Pixelarticons (mode icons — "degraded" glyphs)

The pixel glyphs stacked under each mode icon (the low-quality/degraded state of
the "degraded → sharp" morph) are individual SVGs from **Pixelarticons** by
**Gerrit Halfmann**, inlined in `popup.js` (`ICONS`). Only the glyphs actually
used are vendored: `power`, `sparkle`, `shield`, `speed-medium`, `arrow-bar-right`,
`zap` (mode icons). The copo americano, can and long-neck bottle glyphs labeling the
PIX amount chips (Brazil only) are original line icons drawn for this project (not
from Pixelarticons) and carry no third-party claim; the mug there is Lucide `beer`.

## 5. Lucide (interface icons — "sharp" glyphs)

The clean vector glyphs (the sharp/synced state of the morph, plus the single
support/indicator icons) are individual SVGs from **Lucide**, inlined in
`popup.js` (`ICONS`). Only the glyphs actually used are vendored: `power`,
`sparkles`, `shield`, `gauge`, `arrow-right-to-line`, `zap`, `check`, `wifi`,
`sliders-horizontal`, `coffee`, `beer`.
