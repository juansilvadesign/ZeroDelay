// ZeroDelay — keep YouTube live streams in real time

// Pure catch-up controller — the core "how fast should we play to trim latency"
// math, extracted from inject.js so it can be unit-tested without a browser.
//
// Dual-loaded on purpose:
//   • Browser: loaded as a CLASSIC script (before inject.js) and exposes
//     `window.ZeroDelay.createController`. `module` is undefined there, so the
//     CommonJS branch is skipped.
//   • Node/tests: the sibling `engine/package.json` ({"type":"commonjs"}) makes
//     Node treat this file as CommonJS even though the root package is ESM, so
//     `module.exports` works and `window` is undefined.
